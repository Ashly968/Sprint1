**Individual - Sprint 1**

**User Story #35**

* This user story consisted in finding a game engine that would allow us to start the development of our game.
  * The game engine which we found and decided as a group we would work on is libGDX. This open source engine has a variety of pros and cons that we will have to work on in order to implement the game.
      
* Pros:
          
  * Some pros that can libGDX has is that... It has an extensive list of built-in features, as well as tool support & a large ecosystem. We should also not forget that it supports multiple platforms. 

        
* Cons:
          
  * Some cons that can be found and that we might have to go through is the learning time (as we will have to be constantly reading about aspects that might pause us from continuing). Other cons we can find that might not have much weight in our project as im not 100% sure we will be using those aspects, or that we will have problems with it is that it has a lacking of built-in networking solutions, limited 3D support, & a manual memory storage.

**User Story #37**
* This user story was created in order for us to investigate information; that would allow us to understand the surrounding regards the creation of the game.
       
**Info obtain through my investigation (not yet verified)**
  *  Step 1: Install Java Development Kit (JDK) we must know that before you begin with LibGDX, you need to have the JDK (Java Development Kit) installed.
  *  Step 2: Install Gradle. LibGDX uses Gradle for project management and builds. You can either use Gradle's wrapper (automatically included in LibGDX projects) or install Gradle locally.
  *  Step 3: Install IDE (Integrated Development Environment) "As we have intelliJ installed we don't need to complete this step".
  *  Step 4: Use the LibGDX Setup Tool. this step can be completed by going to libGDX official page with this info we must fill in the project details. Such as name, packege, game class, destination, platform that you are targeting.
    after this you will generate the project and download and eztract the .zip fill that will contain your project.
  * Step 5: Open the Project in Your IDE. you will open the IDEA and import the Gradle project.
  * After this step we will start to build and run our first project

  **Troubleshooting and key remainders**

Verify Java and Gradle Installation: Ensure both Java and Gradle are properly installed and their paths are set in your environment variables.
IDE Gradle Integration: If Gradle tasks arenâ€™t working in your IDE, make sure the Gradle wrapper is being used and the project is synced correctly.
Backup Your Project Regularly: Use a version control system like Git to manage changes and avoid losing progress.

**User Story #43**
    * This other user study was done to have in mind of what we were creating(in a very general aspect).
